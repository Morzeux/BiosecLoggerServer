> In current time authentication through password is not good enough and research
> deals with another options, which could be used to increase password
> protection. Most secure option to authenticate is through protection with some
> of the user’s biometric characteristics. One of them is keystroke dynamics, which
> explores uniqueness of writing style and which in compare with other biometric
> characteristics does not need any additional hardware.

> In this work we will deal with usability of different biometric characteristics
> on smartphone platform. For keystroke dynamics we will design, implement and
> confirm solution, which will include over standard measurable values another
> values specific for smartphone platform. Most of them are measurable due to
> touchscreen and position sensors. Among those values are accelerometer and
> gyroscope.

> The goal of this work is to increase protection of user’s authentication during
> login, as also to identify external impacts, which might have negative effect for
> sensitivity of biometrics protection and to find optimal solution to fulfill that goal.

> Results of our work has shown that accelerometer and gyroscope are not
> sensitive enough to authenticate user. However we managed to find and verify a
> solution with accuracy of authentication over 90%.
